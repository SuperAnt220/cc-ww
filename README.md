The idea for this datapack was inspired by "The room" games, I tried to aim for their not too easy but not too hard puzzles and satisfying interactivity.

In this datapack, you‚Äôll occasionally encounter a mysterious Wandering Wizard instead of a Wandering Trader. Trade with him to obtain a special map that leads you to a curious surface platform with a map scanner. Insert the map, and watch as the platform transforms into an elevator, carrying you down into the heart of the CyberChamber.

The CyberChamber features a few interactive puzzles with animated java animations, that upon solving will grant you the powerful item which Wandering Wizard was studying.

Notes: please turn on particles if you have them off, and don't place the structure with a /place command when testing, find a naturally spawned one. Recommended playing with sounds turned on.

## Other side notes
The first day of the jam I got sick and recovered from it only 3 days before the 3 week jam deadline. The first 2 weeks I was focused on all of the things such as making the structure, the map, the beard and hat model for the wandering wizard, the final item, so they are all pretty polished, but basically most of the cyberchamber puzzles I speedran in the last 3 days of the jam not sleeping for 1 night, so I had to do things quicker and simpler, like using vanilla textures than texturing all of that myself. I have LOTS of stuff planned for this datapack after this jam, because it has a lot of potential, I can make a lot more puzzles (at the start I was planning for making 5-6 puzzles, ended up making 3), better models and textures, more detailed and satisfying sound design, randomization of the solutions to the puzzles in different structures, different conduits for different abilities, etc. etc. so yeah I just wanted to say that this jam was very fun and I learned a bunch of stuff about structures and practiced a lot of animated java, made my first not so bad models with custom textures, so thank you to switched cube, other judges and participants of this jam for making this thing cool and worth it üëç

**Enjoy!**
